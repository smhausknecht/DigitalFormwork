DigitalFormwork is a Grasshopper plug-in that enables 3D-printed formwork design, offering support for modeling formwork and analyzing its removability and manufacturability.
It offers components in the following categories:
Analysis:
-	Generate Vector From Mesh Face Normal
-	Generate Vector From Brep Face Normal
-	View Removal Vector Coverage On Mesh
-	View Removal Vector Coverage On Brep (currently limited to Breps with planar faces)
-	Check Formwork Removal
-	Check Print Volume
Modeling:
-	Offset Brep
-	Cut Solid Mesh By Planes
-	Cut Solid Brep By Planes
-	Cut Solid Mesh By Surfaces
-	Cut Solid Brep By Surfaces
-	Create Mesh Shell with Plane
-	Create Brep Shell with Plane
-	Create Mesh Shell with Mesh Surface
-	Create Brep Shell with Brep Surface
Bugfix:
-	Planarize Mesh
-	Prepare Brep
-	Rebuild Brep
Built for Rhinoceros 8 and Grasshopper version 8.24.25281.15001 using .NET Framework 4.8.
Source code will be published on GitHub in the future.
